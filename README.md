what i did in this project
- created a dynamic grid based off of default value or users value 1-70
- create each square with dom that lsiten for hovers, once user has hovered over square it turns it black.
- the squares are listening for the reset event listener, adding a css animation classname and changing the color to white.
- The Grid is generated by taking default value or users value and creating that number of squares inside a row, and that many rows inside of the grid.
- Allow users to change the size from 1-70, the program runs when a user inputs a new Grid Size, and makes it the same way.

design:
- went for classic etcha sketch look
- for the fonts i found *this font* looked the most similar to the original etcha sketch. and *this font* for the Magic Screen sub text
- added a slight shimmer in CSS for the title logo, to try to give it more of an metalic look
- Screen shakes when picture is reset, and the black squares fade to white. trying to mimick the feel of a etcha sketch.
- this was done by using classes to add animations to each part of the website
- The dials twist when you adjust settings as well being done with CSS and javascript to add and remove the classnames

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
